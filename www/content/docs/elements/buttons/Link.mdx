Whenever possible, links should be visually obvious and explict, and should
never be a suprise functionality within a string of text. Use strategic product
judgement when deciding which link style (underline, no-underline) is
appropriate.

Underline is more visible and should therefore be used in the presence with lots
of static text.

<BorderBox width="100%" justifyContent="center">
  <Serif size="3">
    I agree to Artsy’s <Link href="foo">Privacy Policy</Link>.
  </Serif>
</BorderBox>

<Spacer my={4} />

The prop `noUnderline` should be used when there is available dedicated space,
many links together, with low chance of confusion for static text.

<Playground>
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <Flex width="30%" justifyContent="space-between">
      <Link href="#" noUnderline={true}>
        Delete artwork
      </Link>
      <Link href="#" noUnderline={true}>
        Publish artwork
      </Link>
    </Flex>
  </Flex>

Use color-link when needing to call attention to something vital and a button
isn’t compositionally appropriate. Use sparingly.

<Playground layout="vertical">
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <BorderBox width="30%">
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between" width="100%" alignItems="center">
        <Box>
          <Sans size="2" weight="medium">
            Title
          </Sans>
          <Sans size="2">Subtitle</Sans>
        </Box>
        <Link href="#" noUnderline>
          <Sans size="2" color="purple100">
            Edit
          </Sans>
        </Link>
      </Flex>
    </BorderBox>
  </Flex>
