Whenever possible, links should be visually obvious and explict, and should
never be a suprise functionality within a string of text. Use strategic product
judgement when deciding which link style (underline, no-underline) is
appropriate.

Underline is more visible and should therefore be used in the presence with
lots of static text.

<BorderBox width="100%" justifyContent="center">
  <Serif size="3">
    I agree to Artsy’s <Link href="foo">Privacy Policy</Link>.
  </Serif>
</BorderBox>

<Spacer my={4} />

The prop `underline` can be set to three values:

* default - link has underline
* none - link has no underline
* hover - link has underline only on hover

The `hover` value should be used when there is available dedicated space, many
links together, with low chance of confusion for static text.

<Playground>
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <Flex width="30%" justifyContent="space-between">
      <Link href="#" underlineBehavior="hover">
        Delete artwork
      </Link>
      <Link href="#" underlineBehavior="hover">
        Publish artwork
      </Link>
    </Flex>
  </Flex>
</Playground>

The `none` value should be used with a `color` to call attention to something
vital and a button isn’t compositionally appropriate. Use sparingly.

<Playground layout="vertical">
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <BorderBox width="30%">
      <Flex justifyContent="space-between" width="100%" alignItems="center">
        <Box>
          <Sans size="2" weight="medium">
            Title
          </Sans>
          <Sans size="2">Subtitle</Sans>
        </Box>
        <Link href="#" color="purple100" underlineBehavior="none">
          Edit
        </Link>
      </Flex>
    </BorderBox>
  </Flex>
</Playground>

By default link text is `black100` normally and on hover. If you supply a
color, the hover defaults to `black100`, so if you want the link to always be
the same color, supply both:

<Playground layout="vertical">
  <Flex justifyContent="center">
    <Box width="30%" bg="black100" p={3}>
      <Link href="#" color="white100" hoverColor="white100">
        <Serif>This link text is always white.</Serif>
      </Link>
    </Box>
  </Flex>
</Playground>
