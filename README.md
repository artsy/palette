## What is Palette?

Palette is a collection of primitive, product-agnostic elements that help encapsulate Artsy's look and feel at base level. This project is intended to be used
across our digital product portfolio.

## Does my component belong in Palette?

If the component applies to Artsy as a brand and can/will be used across multiple digital products, then Palette is a great place for it. If it's highly product
specific then it's best to leave the component where it's used. We can always move things later!

## How to contribute

If you'd like to add a new component to Palette please raise the need in our `#design-system` Slack channel.

## Local development

In the project root run the following:

```sh
$ lerna bootstrap
$ yarn storybook
```

This will compile Palette and boot Storybooks, our default development environment. New components require stories.

Other relevant commands are:

```sh
$ yarn test
$ yarn type-check
```

For more info, check out our [development guide in the docs](https://palette.artsy.net/guides/development/).

## Deployment process

### Commits and Deployments

Palette uses [auto-release](https://github.com/intuit/auto-release#readme) to automatically release on every PR. Every PR should have a label that matches one of the following

- Version: Trivial
- Version: Patch
- Version: Minor
- Version: Major
- Canary

Major, minor, and patch will cause a new release to be generated. Use major for breaking changes, minor for new non-breaking features,
and patch for bug fixes. Trivial will not cause a release and should be used when updating documentation or non-project code.

If you don't want to release on a particular PR but the changes aren't trivial then use the `Skip Release` tag along side the appropriate version tag.

`Canary` tags will publish a canary version to NPM which can be used to test work in progress. See [the CircleCI job](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/artsy/palette/4138/workflows/ffc56588-35bf-41ed-a0a8-a806fc807678/jobs/20148) for the exact version published and update your consuming app accordingly.
