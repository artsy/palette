Palette is Artsy's design system. This is a collection of primitive, product-agnostic elements that help ensure consistency and quality across Artsy's products, both in look and feel and overall user experience. This project is a collaborative effort between design and engineering, intended to be used across all Artsy's product ecosystem.
