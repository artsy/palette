# `palette-tokens`

The [design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/) that power [Artsy](https://www.artsy.net)'s [Palette](https://palette.artsy.net).

:warning: This package isn't intended to be consumed directly, but rather included as a transitive dependency of palette. :warning:

## Usage

In the main theme file for a Palette implementation:

```
import tokens from "@artsy/palette-tokens"

/**
 * This is required only in consuming versions of palette to keep
 * the existing api the same. If you're using the tokens as a standalone
 * you may not necessarily need to include this export statement.
 */
export * from "@artsy/palette-tokens";

/**
 * Any platform specific tokens can be included in the final `themeConfig` as
 * shown.
 */
export const themeConfig = {
  ...tokens,
  fontFamily: {
    // ...
  }
}
```
