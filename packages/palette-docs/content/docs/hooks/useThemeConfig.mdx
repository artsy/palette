The `useThemeConfig` hook can be used within components that are _shared_
between v2 and v3 apps, and thus can't be converted wholesale to v3. (A good
example of this is the Artwork Filter, which is a complex component used in a
couple different places.)

### Usage

```jsx
import { useThemeConfig, Box, Text, TextVariant } from "@artsy/palette"

const App = props => {
  const tokens = useThemeConfig({
    v2: {
      px: 5,
      variant: "title" as TextVariant,
    },
    v3: {
      px: 2,
      variant: "lg" as TextVariant,
    },
  })

  return (
    <Box px={tokens.px}>
      <Text variant={tokens.variant}>Hi</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

What we're doing in the above is defining an object with two keys -- `v2` and
`v3` -- and the `useThemeConfig` hook will then match against the keys depending
on which theme context is currently being used and return the correct values. So
you can see that

```tsx
<Box px={tokens.px}>
  <Text variant={tokens.variant}>Hi</Text>
</Box>
```

Will return dynamic values for `tokens.px` -- either `px={5}` if `v2`, or
`px={2}` if `v3`.
