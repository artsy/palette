The `useFocusLock` hook traps focus within the given element such that when a
user Tab or Shift+Tabs, focus is only cycled through nodes contained within that
element.

This is of particular relevance when constructing modals. Consider the situation
where you tab past the last element in a modal. Without trapping the focus
within the dialog, focus moves into a part of the page that you can't click
without closing the modal.

### Usage

```tsx
import { useFocusLock } from "@artsy/palette"

const Example = (props) => {
  const containerEl = useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)

  useFocusLock(containerEl)

  return (
    <>
      <input placeholder="Cannot tab into" />

      <Box ref={containerEl}>
        <input placeholder="First tabstop" />
        <input placeholder="Second tabstop" />
        <button>Third tabstop</button>
      </Box>
    </>
  )
}
```
