name: PageLoader
---

A `PageLoader` component is used when transitioning between two pages in a
single-page-app / turbo-links like way. By default, the loading animation is
faked -- meaning, supply it with a starting percentage, and it will gradually
animate towards completion. If you would like to retain control over the percent
loaded then that will have to be passed in as props as changes occur.

By passing in `complete={true}` or `percentComplete={100}` the `PageLoader` will
animate out.

<Playground>
  <PageLoader
    highlight="purple100"
    percentComplete={0}
    complete={false}
    showBackground={true}
  />
</Playground>
