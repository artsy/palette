Palette is Artsy's design system. This is a collection of primitive,
product-agnostic elements that help ensure consistency and quality across
Artsy's products, both in look and feel and overall user experience. This
project is a collaborative effort between design and engineering, intended to be
used across all Artsy's product ecosystem.

### Getting Started

To add Palette into your app, install it as a package:

```bash
$ yarn add @artsy/palette
```

And at the root of your component tree instantiate `<GlobalStyles />` and add
the `<Theme>` provider:

```tsx
import { Theme, injectGlobalStyles } from "@artsy/palette"

const { GlobalStyles } = injectGlobalStyles(`
  // overrides and additions
`)

export const App = (props) => {
  return (
    <Theme theme="v3">
      <>
        <GlobalStyles />
        ...
      </>
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

From there you should be able to access the values from Palette's
[Theme.tsx](https://github.com/artsy/palette/blob/main/packages/palette/src/Theme.tsx)
file:

```tsx
import { BorderBox, Flex, Text } from '@artsy/palette

const Artworks = props => {
  return (
    <Flex>
      <BorderBox p={2}>
        <Text variant='md'>
          About the work
        </Text>
      </BorderBox>

      <BorderBox ml={2}>
        <Text variant='sm'>
          Details
        </Text>
      </BorderBox>
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

### Adding Fonts

In order to use Artsy's fonts, you'll also want to add our webfont file to the
CSS in the header of your app. Here are a few common examples:

Add to the `head` of your document:

```html
<head>
  <link
    href="https://webfonts.artsy.net/all-webfonts.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
    type="text/css"
  />
</head>
```

Using [react-head](https://github.com/tizmagik/react-head):

```tsx
import { HeadProvider, Link } from "react-head"

const App = () => (
  <HeadProvider>
    <Link
      href="https://webfonts.artsy.net/all-webfonts.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
    />
  </HeadProvider>
)
```

Using [React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet):

```tsx
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet"

const App = () => (
  <Helmet>
    <link
      href="https://webfonts.artsy.net/all-webfonts.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
    />
  </Helmet>
)
```

If you're using Next.js, Gatsby or any other framework the patterns should be
similar.
