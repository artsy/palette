The `<ResponsiveBox>` component can be used to responsively scale a content
area.

### Responsive image

You may wish to include an image that responsively scales down with the width of
the container. Try scaling the viewport smaller than the below image.

<Playground>
  <ResponsiveBox
    aspectWidth={700}
    aspectHeight={400}
    maxWidth={700}
    maxHeight={400}
  >
    <Image
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      src="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400"
      srcSet="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400 1x, https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/1400/800 2x"
      alt="Please make sure you describe the image"
    />
  </ResponsiveBox>
</Playground>

You may wish to keep the image at 100% width, regardless of the original native
width of the image.

<Playground>
  <ResponsiveBox aspectWidth={700} aspectHeight={400} maxWidth="100%">
    <Image
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      src="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400"
      srcSet="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400 1x, https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/1400/800 2x"
      alt="Please make sure you describe the image"
    />
  </ResponsiveBox>
</Playground>

### Placeholders

Also useful when displaying fallback placeholders.

<Playground>
  <ResponsiveBox
    aspectWidth={16}
    aspectHeight={9}
    maxWidth="100%"
    bg="black10"
  />
</Playground>
