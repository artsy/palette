The `<Join>` component is useful for applying a separating component between a
series of components. It's often useful for DRYing up layouts that have
consistent spacing between then, but for which a `<Spacer>` or `space` props are
added to each element.

### Example

<Playground>
  <Join separator={<Spacer my={1} border="1px solid black" />}>
    <Text variant="sm-display">A component for joining together</Text>
    <Text variant="sm-display">children via a custom separator</Text>
  </Join>
</Playground>
