name: TimeRemaining

TimeRemaining will countdown if `currentTime` isn't directly passed to the
component. Try it yourself by removing the prop and setting `countDownEnd` to
the near future.

<Playground>
  <TimeRemaining
    currentTime="2019-01-02T20:15:00.000-04:00"
    countdownEnd="2019-01-03T20:15:00.000-04:00"
    highlight="purple100"
  />
</Playground>
