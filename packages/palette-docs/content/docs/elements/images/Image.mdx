  <Image
    width="300px"
    height="200px"
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/300/?random"
  />

## Lazy loaded image

For situations where an image is displayed below the fold, use the `lazyLoad`
prop. This is an important performance optimization.

<Playground>
  <Image
    lazyLoad
    width="300px"
    height="200px"
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/200/?random"
  />
</Playground>

## Preventing right-click

We generally don't want artwork images to be downloaded by users. Mark an image
with the `preventRightClick` prop, and users will be unable to right click to
"Save Image".

<Playground>
  <Image
    width="300px"
    height="200px"
    src="https://picsum.photos/300/200/?random"
    preventRightClick
  />

## Responsive image recipe using an Image component

You may wish to include an image that responsively scales down with the width of the container.
Try scaling the viewport smaller than the below image.

<Playground>
  <ResponsiveBox aspectWidth={700} aspectHeight={400} maxWidth={700} maxHeight={400}>
    <Image
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      src="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400"
      srcSet="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400 1x, https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/1400/800 2x"
      alt="Please make sure you describe the image"
    />
  </ResponsiveBox>
</Playground>

You may wish to keep the image at 100% width, regardless of the original native width of the image.

<Playground>
  <ResponsiveBox aspectWidth={700} aspectHeight={400} maxWidth="100%">
    <Image
      width="100%"
      height="100%"
      src="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400"
      srcSet="https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/700/400 1x, https://picsum.photos/seed/hello/1400/800 2x"
      alt="Please make sure you describe the image"
    />
  </ResponsiveBox>
</Playground>
