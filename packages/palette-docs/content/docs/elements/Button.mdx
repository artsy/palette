Primary buttons should be used for the primary desired user action. Do not use
two primary buttons in the same screen. If there are multiple primary options,
use secondary-gray.

<Playground>
  <Button>Purchase</Button>
</Playground>

Our secondary-outline is our default secondary button style. Avoid using this in
the presence of inputs, as to not confuse itâ€™s use.

<Playground>
  <Flex>
    <Button mr={1}>Purchase</Button>
    <Button variant="secondaryOutline">Make offer</Button>
  </Flex>
</Playground>

When needing to provide the ability to show more content, we always use the
secondary-outline style.

<Box>
  <Button variant="secondaryOutline" width="33%">
    Show more
  </Button>
</Box>

### Loading states

The loading state is used when there may be a delay in response time, ie,
bidding, or following an artist.

<Playground>
  <Button loading>Show more</Button>
</Playground>

### Disabled

Like other form elements, buttons can be disabled.

<Playground>
  <Button disabled>Submit</Button>
</Playground>

### Focused

<Playground>
  <Button focused>Submit</Button>
</Playground>

### Hover

<Playground>
  <Button hover>Submit</Button>
</Playground>

### 100% width

Button accepts all `BoxProps`.

<Playground>
  <Button width="100%" size="medium">
    Reset
  </Button>
</Playground>

### In the context of a form

A button defaults to type submit, so when used in the context of a form, a click
will submit the form. This means that if you have more than one Button in a
form, you'll probably want to override the type of one of the buttons:

<Playground>
  <form>
    <Button type="button" mr={1}>
      Submit
    </Button>
    <Button variant="secondaryOutline">Cancel</Button>
  </form>
</Playground>
