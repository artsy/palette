`Clickable` Clickable is a utility component useful for wrapping things like
`div`s without having to deal with the requirements to make the `div`
accessible. It is the web-equivalent of `TouchableWithoutFeedback`. It supports
the same system props as `<Box />`

<Playground>
  <Clickable onClick={() => alert("Clicked")}>
    <Sans size="4">Click</Sans>
  </Clickable>
</Playground>
