When building layouts and components, palette hooks into a handful of
[reusable base-10 spacing units](https://github.com/artsy/palette/blob/master/packages/palette-tokens/src/themes/v3.tsx#L98-L112).
With ten pixels as the base, `1` equals `10px`, `2` equals `20px`, `.5` equals
`5px` (and so on). This allows us to constrain the possibilities available to a
component to only what's defined in our spacing system and thus reduce drift.

This means that in practice one should rarely use concrete pixel values. For
example:

### Avoid

<Playground layout="horizontal">
  <Box mt="10px" p="20px">
    <Button>View more</Button>
  </Box>
</Playground>

Notice how we're passing in pixel values in `mt` and `p`? This should be revised
as seen below.

### Apply this spacing pattern

<Playground layout="horizontal">
  <Box mt={1} p={2}>
    <Button variant="secondaryOutline">View more</Button>
  </Box>
</Playground>

### All spacing values

<Box as="pre" mb={4}>
  {JSON.stringify(THEME_V3.space, null, 2)}
</Box>
