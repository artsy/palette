The Artsy color palette has been updated to improve the accessibility. Each
color has been adjusted to ensure sufficient contrast and has specific roles as
to which colors can be used in conjunction with each other.

<Spacer my={4} />

<GridColumns>
  {Object.entries(THEME_V3.colors).map(([key, value]) => {
    return (
      <Column span={3}>
        <ColorComponent color={key} />
      </Column>
    )
  })}
</GridColumns>

### How to Use

Assuming the component tree has been wrapped in a `<Theme>` context provider,
all color values should be available for use within Palette components. For
example:

<Playground>
  <BorderBox backgroundColor="black5">
    <Text color="brand">Banksy</Text>
  </BorderBox>
</Playground>
