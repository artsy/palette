name: React Storybooks

When developing new components we use [Storybooks](https://storybook.js.org/).
This allows us to rapidly iterate in a self-contained environment, while
additionally allowing for a quick overview of a components full API.

See: [Palette Storybooks](https://palette-storybook.artsy.net/)

While we strive to keep things aligned between Storybooks and our docs, be aware
that sometimes things can be out of sync! If you see something that's missing in
the docs but is present in Storybooks, please file
[a ticket in JIRA](https://artsyproduct.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/WP/boards/97).

For more information, check out our [Development Guide](/guides/development/).
