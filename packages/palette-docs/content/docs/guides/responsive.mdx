One of the core features of Palette is it's use of
[responsive props](https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles/) (or
[array props](https://styled-system.com/guides/array-props/)). This unique
feature was first introduced by [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/), the
underlying library we use for much of Palette's functionality, and allows devs
to write fully responsive components by expanding normal react props into an
array, with each slot representing a breakpoint.

### Example

The below will serve to clarify:

<Playground>
  <BorderBox width={["25%", "50%", "75%", "100%"]}>
    <Text variant={["xl", "lg", "md", "sm"]}>
      At xs the box is 25% wide, and greater than xs matches breakpoints going
      up to the largest. Scale the browser to see it in action.
    </Text>
  </BorderBox>
</Playground>

All props in Palette are responsive like this which makes for extremely rapid 
iteration times when compared with conventional css-based media query approaches.

[styled-system docs](https://styled-system.com/guides/array-props/). Also check 
out our comprehensive blogpost on how we handle responsive layouts [when 
server-side rendering](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/05/24/server-rendering-responsively/). 

### Developer flow

Different engineers will approach layout and responsive props in their own way,
but a suggested approach would be to build out your layout using normal,
non-array props, and then once the desktop version looks good, go back and
annotate your components with array props, representing the mobile view. In
practice this works well.

### All Breakpoints

<Box as="pre" mb={4}>
  {JSON.stringify(breakpoints, null, 2)}
</Box>
