name: Migrating from v2 to v3

In an attempt to make our brand more consistent and easier to design for, in
2021 we began the process of simplifying Palette to reduce the amount of visual
information in the system. Less Typography choices, less spacing options, less
colors. While this has largely gone smoothly, there are some things to be aware
of.

**For reference, check out the difference between our v2 and v3 themes below:**

**v2**:
[palette-tokens/v2](https://github.com/artsy/palette/blob/master/packages/palette-tokens/src/themes/v2.tsx)

**v3**:
[palette-tokens/v3](https://github.com/artsy/palette/blob/master/packages/palette-tokens/src/themes/v3.tsx)

### How to Migrate

While most migration work will be happening in
[Force](https://github.com/artsy/force), we use Palette all across Artsy,
including a lighter React Native version in
[Eigen](https://github.com/artsy/eigen). Each app will likely have its own
patterns for toggling between v2 and v3, but in short migrating is as simple as
importing the `<ThemeProviderV3>` context and placing it at the top of the
component tree that you'd like to migrate:

```tsx
import { ThemeProviderV3 } from "@artsy/palette"

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProviderV3>
      <App />
    </ThemeProviderV3>
  )
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the theme version using the main `<Theme>` component:

```tsx
import { Theme } from "@artsy/palette"

const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <Theme theme="v3">
      <App />
    </Theme>
  )
}
```

This is useful if you're programmatically setting things, as we do in Force
[via our route config](https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/master/src/v2/Apps/Artwork/artworkRoutes.tsx#L14).

Once the component tree is wrapped in the correct provider you should be able to
access our
[v3 theme](https://github.com/artsy/palette/blob/master/packages/palette-tokens/src/themes/v3.tsx).

### Using the `useThemeConfig` hook

The `useThemeConfig` hook can be used within components that are _shared_
between v2 and v3 apps, and thus can't be converted wholesale to v3. (A good
example of this is the Artwork Filter, which is a complex component used in a
couple different places.)

```jsx
import { useThemeConfig, Box, Text, TextVariant } from "@artsy/palette"

const MyComponent = props => {
  const tokens = useThemeConfig({
    v2: {
      px: 5,
      variant: "title" as TextVariant,
    },
    v3: {
      px: 2,
      variant: "lg" as TextVariant,
    },
  })

  return (
    <Box px={tokens.px}>
      <Text variant={tokens.variant}>Hi</Text>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

What we're doing in the above is defining an object with two keys -- `v2` and `v3` -- and the
`useThemeConfig` hook will then match against the keys depending on which theme context is 
currently being used and return the correct values. So you can see that 

```tsx
<Box px={tokens.px}>
  <Text variant={tokens.variant}>Hi</Text>
</Box>
``` 

Will return dynamic values for `tokens.px` -- either `px={5}` if `v2`, or `px={2}` if `v3`.  


(See
[here](https://github.com/artsy/force/blob/master/src/v2/Components/Footer/Footer.tsx#L219-L226)
for a real-world example.)

### Typography

We've simplified our typography choices down to six choices, as can be
[seen here](/atoms/typography).

Variants are now generic size values (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, and so on) rather than
context-specific names (`title`, `subTitle`, etc.)

If migrating from pre-v1 `<Sans>` or `<Serif>` components, note that we no
longer use serif fonts and areas where those components are used should be
replaced with `<Text>`.

**Some migration examples:**

<Playground>
  <BorderBox display="block">
    <Serif size={4}>We no longer use Serif</Serif>
    <Text variant="subTitle">We no longer use context variants</Text>
  </BorderBox>
</Playground>

**Do this instead:**

<Playground>
  <BorderBox>
    <Text variant="lg">Now we use the text component across the board</Text>
  </BorderBox>
</Playground>

### Spacing Scale

See our [docs on Spacing](/atoms/spacing/#all-spacing-values) for the full list,
but in particular the often-used `3 = 30px` is no longer available.

If migrating a page, v2 values that no longer exist in v3 will collapse to zero.

### Colors

See our [docs on Colors](/atoms/colors) for the full list.
