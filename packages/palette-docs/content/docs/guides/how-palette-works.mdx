name: How Palette Works

When we first began building Artsy's Design System we wanted something that
could serve as a good foundation for low and high-level components, while also
being intuitive for our development team. Some of us were facinated with
[functional css](https://www.htmlgoodies.com/css/brief-introduction-to-functional-css/)
but having worked with React,
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and various CSS-in-JS
libraries, we wanted something that was less vanilla CSS than React props,
something that we could easly use with TypeScript. Pretty quickly we stumbled
upon a brilliant library by [Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/) called
[styled-system](https://styled-system.com/) that combined all of these things.

### Styled System

Styled System bills itself as a way to "build custom UI components with
constraint-based style props based on scales defined in your theme." There's a
lot here, but in short what it means is: Take some values defined in a theme,
define some function mixins to consume values in the theme, and map the output
to React component props.

For example:

```js
import { space } from "styled-system"
import { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components"

const Box = styled.div`
  ${space};
`

const theme = {
  space: {
    1: "10px",
    2: "20px",
    3: "30px",
    4: "40px",
  },
}

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Box p={2}>This is a box with 20px padding</Box>
    </ThemeProvider>
  )
}
```

What we're doing is creating a new primative component called `Box` that
mixes-in a `space` function from `styled-system`. This function then "decorates"
the component with a [handful of props](https://styled-system.com/api#space)
that then read in the theme and allow the develper quick ways to access the
values. One of those props is `p` (shorthand for `padding`), and by passing in
`2` we're saying "look at `theme.space`, find the key for `p={2}` and return the
value" - which equals `20px`. And with TypeScript, we get really nice
intellisense as well as type-checking of the values passed into the prop. 

At scale and across a big dev team, this works well after the basics are
understood. Our UI becomes like lego blocks, where the theme ("constraints")
defines the shape of the pieces that are available. Design drift no more. 

A fuller example of `Box` from the Palette codebase:

```tsx
/**
 * All the system functions for Box
 */
export const boxMixin = compose(
  background,
  border,
  color,
  layout,
  position,
  space,
  textAlign
)

export const Box = styled.div`
  ${boxMixin}
`
```

You can see that not only is there the `space` mixin, but also `background` and
`position` and others, each providing their own set of props that we can then tap
into directly on the `Box` component.

Similarly, lets define a `Flex` component:

```tsx
import { flexbox } from "styled-system"

const Flex = styled.div`
  ${flexbox};
`
```

Now with this defined, we can then create something more complex:

```tsx
const Banner = ({ message, isPriority }) => {
  return (
    <Flex flexDirection="row" justifyContent="space-between">
      <Box px={2} bgColor="brand">
        {message}
      </Box>

      {isPriority && <PriorityIcon />}
    </Flex>
  )
}
```

Under the hood we're laying out the component into a container that displays a
message and, if `isPriority` is set, optionally shows an icon. The contents are
distributed evenly across the containing space thanks to the `justifyContent`
prop being set to `space-between` on the `<Flex>` component container. No
long-hand css required, and everything is type-checked. In fact, unless you're
building something unconventionally complex, you should never need to use
vanilla css or conventional styled components again; everything you could need
is defined within our primatives in Palette.
