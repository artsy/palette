## **Terminology**

**Token**: Should primarily be a value, functionally agnostic. 

**Element**: Composition of various tokens. Specific function, content agnostic.

**Component**: Composition of various elements, may serve specific functionality that applies to a variety of content use cases.

**Utility**: Specific function, is either not visible or exists temporarily.
<Separator my={4} />

## Sizes and naming

We only use the following variables to describe sizes: x-small (xs), small (sm), medium (md), large (lg), x-large (xl).

If a similar component comes in more than one size, the components should be named as explicitly as possible to it's use and function, so that people will understand when and how to use it. (e.g. Input, QuickInput).

<Separator my={4} />

## States

We use the following terminology to describe common states: default, hover, active, disabled, error.
